            <h4 class="content-title left1 right1">Who I Am.</h4>
            <p class="mycontent left1 right1">On paper, I'm a computer scientist. To most people that probably means I spend hours learning the ins and outs of coding languages, spend more time talking to my computer than I do to other people, and my mornings begin with an energy drink because sometimes I sleep a lot less than I probably should. While partially true, above all else my computer is the way I give to others. It's my way to give to people experiences, information, laughs, energy, community, and happiness. Because after all, I've found that there is no better feeling than helping to improve people's lives without an expectation of equal return. So yes, I'm a Computer Scientist, but that doesn't mean I chose it so I don't have to talk to other people or to avoid going out in the sunlight. I chose programming because it is a tool I can use better someone's life while improving my own. I hope you enjoy my website, and good luck to you!</p>

            <h4 class="content-title left2 right2"> What I'm Up to.</h4>
            <p class="mycontent left2 right2">Besides being a full time student at Kansas State University I spend my time playing soccer, lifting weights, running, participating in the KSU Mobile Development Club, and working at General Electric Aviation Systems as an Engineer/Technologist. I've worked at GE for about a year and a half now, full-time and part-time during the school year. Needless to say, I like to stay busy. Whether its soccer, school, work, or otherwise, I'm always looking for something meaningful to fill my time with.</p>
