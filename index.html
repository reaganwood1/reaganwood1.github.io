            <p class="mycontent left1 right1">On paper, I'm a computer scientist. To most people that probably means I spend hours learning the ins and outs of coding languages, spend more time talking to my computer than I do to other people, and my mornings begin with a Mountain Dew Kickstart because sometimes I sleep a lot less than I probably should. While these are partially true, above all else my computer is the way I give. It's my way to give to people experiences, information, laughs, energy, community, and happiness. Because after all, I've found that there is no better feeling than helping to improve people's lives without an expectation of equal return. So yes, Computer science is the representation of my purpose, and with it I give my best to others.</p>
